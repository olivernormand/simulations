# Simulations

### Gravity

n-body simulation using 4th order RK integration methods.

Able to specify initial position and velocity of n-particles, subsequent evolution of paths are calculated and exported as an mp4 file.

### Collisions

Simulation of n-particles on a 1D line. Able to specify particle mass, initial positions and velocity. Can visualise the particles colliding over time, in addition to plotting their average kinetic energies. Incidentally, shows graphically that the average kinetic energy of a particle is independent of its mass.
